### Architecture

Based on the [recommended app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide#recommended-app-arch)

- UI layer (or presentation layer): Contains UI classes (Activities and Fragments) and ViewModels.
- Domain layer:
  The domain layer is responsible for encapsulating complex business logic, or simple business logic that is reused by multiple ViewModels. 
  Contains domain models and Use cases.
- Data layer:
  The data layer of an app contains the business logic. The business logic is what gives value to your appâ€”it's made of rules that determine how your app creates, stores, and changes data. 
  Contains DataSources (Remote data source, paging data source, ...), Repositories and API Calls.
